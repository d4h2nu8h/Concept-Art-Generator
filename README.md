### Concept Art Generator

Concept Art Generator is a project that utilizes generative AI and natural language processing to generate concept art based on user prompts. It leverages the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models to create unique and imaginative artwork.

This repository contains the source code and necessary files to run the Concept Art Generator. The project is built using a combination of technologies, including React, Node.js, REST APIs, and GPT models.

### Features

### Generate Concept Art: Users can input prompts or descriptions to generate concept art images.

### Interactive User Interface: 

The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with React, allowing users to easily interact with the generator.

### Seamless Integration:

The project integrates with REST APIs and leverages the power of GPT models to generate high-quality concept art.
### Scalable and Extensible:

The codebase is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features or modify existing functionality.
### Easy Setup:

The repository includes detailed instructions on how to set up and run the Concept Art Generator on your local machine.
